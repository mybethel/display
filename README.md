Bethel Display
===

Early work in progress.

Display aims to be an open and extensible API-first alternative to presentation
programs built for the modern Church. Where existing offerings are complex,
unintuitive and expensive, Display aims to provide a cross-platform alternative.

Built to take advantage of the performance of the native GPU while allowing the
extensibility of modern web technologies. Display can run on a Mac with multiple
monitors or over the network allowing multiple platforms to control.

Crafted with Love.
